# Final-Project
Reinforcement Learning

This is my final project for the 2018 University of Denver Data Analytics Boot Camp.
The main prescribed requirement for the project was that it should make use of machine learning.
In class, we had covered supervised and unsupervised learning, but my background in instrumentation and controls led me to be interested in Reinforcement Learning.  Since Reinforcement Learning had not been covered in class, my presentation began with a background overview.
